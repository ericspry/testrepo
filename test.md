Gila River Telecommunications, Inc.:  The project will study the effects of varying subsidy amounts and choices for speed.

Gila River, in partnership with NeoNova Network Services, Inc., Tinhorn Consulting and Letha Lamb, will test the effect of subsidy amounts, access to discounted equipment and broadband speeds on adoption by randomly assigning subscribers into five groups based on different price points, speed and access to equipment, which includes the use of a control group.  The subsidy amounts for the broadband plans range from $23.24 to $38.24 with varying speeds.  Gila River will track which consumers choose to participate based on the variations in broadband service.  Lifeline support for this project will not exceed $323,100, and includes reimbursement for non-recurring fees.

Hopi, in partnership with Connected Nation, will test the effect of subsidy amounts, access to discounted equipment and broadband speeds on adoption by offering a flat subsidy of $39.95 for three different plans with variations on end-user charge depending on speed, and access to discounted equipment.  Hopi Telecommunications will be able to report on which prices were more effective in increasing adoption and the impacts on having access to discounted equipment.  Lifeline support for this project will not exceed $226,752, with no reimbursement for non-recurring fees.

Nexus:  The project will study the effects of varying subsidy amounts, usage limits and access to digital literacy.
 
Nexus, in partnership with Connect Ohio, will test the effect of subsidy amounts and digital literacy on adoption by giving one group of subscribers a $15 subsidy, a second group $20 and a third no subsidy (groups are offered plans based on zip code).  These subsidies will lower the offered price by the subsidy amount for a menu of plans, which are varied based on usage limits.  By allowing customers to select their usage limits, Nexus will be able to report subscribers’ willingness to pay for data limit increases and also learn if subscribers were satisfied retrospectively with their choice.  Lifeline support for this project will not exceed $2,800,000, with no reimbursement for non-recurring fees.

TracFone Smartphone Project:  The project will study the
effects of subsidy amounts and discounted hardware.

TracFone, in partnership with Technology Goes Home, will test the effect of both discounted price and hardware cost on mobile broadband adoption and retention using four variations in its broadband service plans and one control group randomly assigned over a large, geographically diverse sample.  By offering varying combinations of free or discounted hardware and $10 or $20 per month service, low-income customers’ sensitivity to upfront and ongoing prices can be measured.  By comparing the two variations in offers with the control group, which is priced at market rate, TracFone will be able to estimate the take-rate for each price point with 2 GB on data limits.  Lifeline support for this project will not exceed $915,000, with no reimbursement for non-recurring fees.

NTCA Application:  The project will study the effects of decreasing subsidy amounts over the year.
 
The NTCA Application, which includes Alpine Communications (IA) and Leaco Rural Telephone (NM), in partnership with Connected Nation, will test subsidy design by offering a range of wireline broadband plans in one state with a flat subsidy amount of $25 per month for all 12 months and offering a range of wireline broadband plans in another state with a sliding scale subsidy that is initially $40 per month for the first quarter and is reduced each quarter thereafter in increments of $10, with the last quarter providing a subsidy of $10 per month, thereby increasing the monthly end-user charge by $30.  Lifeline support for this project will not exceed $202,652, and includes reimbursement for non-recurring fees.  The budget is broken-up between the ETCs as follows: Alpine Communications’ budget will not exceed $35,995; and Leaco Rural Telephone’s budget will not exceed $166,657.

Partnership for a Connected Illinois Project:  The project will study the effects of access to digital literacy and consumers’ choice among plans offering varying speed.
 
The Partnership for a Connected Illinois Project, in partnership with Connected Living, Inc., Citizens Utility Board, and John B. Horrigan, will focus on studying the impact of digital literacy on adoption among the member ETCs by tracking usage and retention of service during the 12 month pilot to determine if such training helps subscribers overcome adoption hurdles (e.g., relevance, privacy concerns).  This project will test the impact of digital literacy by offering one group of subscribers a flat rate $30 subsidy for 12 months off each of the ETCs’ broadband plans that are priced based on speed, as well as intensive digital literacy training, and a second group of subscribers will receive the same $30 subsidy but will not receive an offer for digital literacy training.  The project will also study the choices subscribers make in determining speeds because they will be allowed to choose from speed packages offered by each participating ETC.  Lifeline support will not exceed $1,514,284, and includes reimbursement for non-recurring fees for each ETC.

Frontier:  The project will study the impact of financial incentives to take digital literacy training on broadband adoption.

Frontier, in partnership with Connect Ohio (a subsidiary of Connected Nation) and Mission West Virginia, will test whether offering financial incentives increases the likelihood that subscribers will take digital literacy training.  Frontier will permit subscribers to choose from three offers within the pilot project.  The first is a $20 monthly subsidy off a range of wireline broadband plans.  The second requires participation in a digital literacy program and receives a $30 monthly subsidy and a waiver of the $34.99 non-recurring charge.  The third choice requires participation in a digital literacy program in order to receive the $20 monthly subsidy and a free computer.  For the second and third offers, Frontier will have a test group in which subscribers are required to take training, and a control group, in which subscribers are encouraged to take training but will not receive incentives for doing so.  This project is unique in testing whether a financial incentive to take digital literacy training can help in overcoming adoption hurdles (e.g., addressing relevance, privacy concerns).
